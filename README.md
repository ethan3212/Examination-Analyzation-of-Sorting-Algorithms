This application takes files of various input classes (sorted, random, reverse, and double random) and of varying sizes (100 elements, 500 elements, and 1000 elements) and then uses them to perform 7 sorting routines: Insertion, bubble, shell, radix, heap, merge, and quick. 

The total execution time for each iteration and their respective loop counts are displayed by the application.

The outputs of this program are written to text files which can be used to construct charts so that each routine can be analyzed independently and compared with each other.
