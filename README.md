# Examination-Analyzation-of-Sorting-Algorithms

This application pulls text files containing various types of input classes: sorted, random, reverse, and double random. 
There are three sizes to each of these input classes: 100 elements, 500 elements, and 100 elements.

This application takes these files and performs 7 sorting routines: insertion, bubble, shell, radix, heap, merge, and quick. In addition to performing these algorithms, the application
times each one, diplaying the total execution time for each routine as well as their respective loop counts.

The outputs of this program were written to text files which were later used to construct charts so that each routine could be analized independently and later compared with each other.
