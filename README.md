This application takes files of various input classes (sorted, random, reverse, and double random) and of varying sizes (100 elements, 500 elements, and 1000 elements) and performs 7 sorting routines: Insertion, bubble, shell, radix, heap, merge, and quick. The total execution time for each routine as well as their respective loop counts are calculated and displayed by the application.

The outputs of this program are written to text files which can be used to construct charts so that each routine can be analyzed independently and compared with each other.
